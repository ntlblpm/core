SmartArt-esque Graphics Feature for LibreOffice

OVERVIEW:
SmartArt-like graphics provide users with pre-designed diagram templates that automatically adjust and reformat when content is added or removed. This feature would enable quick creation of professional-looking diagrams for processes, hierarchies, relationships, and cycles.

KEY COMPONENTS:

1. Diagram Types:
   - Process diagrams (linear, chevron, circular)
   - Hierarchy/Organization charts
   - Relationship diagrams (Venn, matrix)
   - Cycle diagrams
   - Pyramid diagrams
   - List diagrams with visual elements

2. Core Functionality:
   - Auto-layout engine that adjusts shapes when content changes
   - Text-to-diagram conversion
   - Style presets with consistent colors and formatting
   - Shape morphing between diagram types
   - Smart connectors that maintain relationships

3. Implementation Approach:
   - Leverage existing LibreOffice Draw shape engine
   - Create layout algorithms for each diagram type
   - Build on top of existing shape styles and effects
   - Store templates as ODF extensions

4. User Workflow:
   a) Insert â†’ SmartArt-like Graphic
   b) Choose diagram type from gallery
   c) Enter text in outline pane or directly in shapes
   d) Diagram auto-adjusts layout
   e) Apply style presets or customize

5. Technical Requirements:
   - Layout calculation algorithms
   - Shape constraint system
   - Template definition format
   - Integration with existing shape properties
   - Undo/redo support for complex operations

6. LibreOffice Integration Points:
   - Draw module for shape rendering
   - Impress for presentation diagrams
   - Writer for in-document diagrams
   - Common style system across applications

BENEFITS:
- Rapid diagram creation without manual layout
- Professional appearance with minimal effort
- Consistency across documents
- Time savings for common diagram types
- Accessibility through structured content

EXISTING FOUNDATION:
- LibreOffice Draw already has shape tools
- Gallery feature for templates exists
- ODF supports custom shapes and groups
- Style system can be extended
