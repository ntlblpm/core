Picture Styles and Effects Feature for LibreOffice

OVERVIEW:
Picture Styles and Effects would bring advanced image styling capabilities to LibreOffice, allowing users to apply professional visual enhancements to images with one-click presets and customizable effects, similar to Microsoft Word's picture formatting features.

KEY COMPONENTS:

1. Picture Styles (One-Click Presets):
   - Simple Frame
   - Shadow Frame
   - Reflection Frame
   - Soft Edge Frame
   - Beveled Frame
   - Metal Frame
   - Shape masks (circle, rounded rectangle, star, torn edges)
   - 3D perspective frames
   - Combination styles (frame + shadow + reflection)

2. Picture Effects:
   a) Shadow Effects:
      - Drop shadow (adjustable angle, distance, blur, color, transparency)
      - Inner shadow
      - Perspective shadow
      - Multiple shadow layers
   
   b) Reflection:
      - Bottom reflection
      - Side reflections
      - Adjustable transparency gradient
      - Reflection distance and blur
   
   c) Glow Effects:
      - Outer glow (color, size, transparency)
      - Inner glow
      - Soft edges with feathering
   
   d) 3D Effects:
      - Bevel (top/bottom, width, height, depth)
      - 3D rotation (X, Y, Z axes)
      - Perspective distortion
      - Depth and contour settings
   
   e) Artistic Effects:
      - Pencil sketch
      - Watercolor
      - Oil painting
      - Blur effects
      - Texture overlays

3. Implementation Architecture:
   - GPU-accelerated rendering using OpenGL/Vulkan
   - Non-destructive effect pipeline
   - Real-time preview system
   - Effect stacking and combination
   - Integration with existing image handling

4. Technical Implementation:
   a) Rendering Pipeline:
      - Original image preservation
      - Effect layer system
      - Composite rendering
      - Cache management for performance
   
   b) Effect Algorithms:
      - Shadow: Gaussian blur + offset + blend
      - Reflection: Flip + gradient mask + blur
      - Glow: Edge detection + blur + blend
      - Bevel: Height map generation + lighting
      - Artistic: Convolution filters + color mapping

5. User Interface:
   - Picture Format sidebar/dialog
   - Live preview on hover
   - Effect gallery with visual previews
   - Adjustable parameters per effect
   - Reset to original option

6. Integration Points:
   - Writer: Inline and floating images
   - Impress: Presentation images
   - Draw: All image objects
   - Calc: Embedded images

7. Performance Considerations:
   - Lazy rendering (only on view/export)
   - Preview quality vs. final quality
   - Hardware acceleration detection
   - Fallback software rendering
   - Memory management for large images

8. File Format Support:
   - Store effects in ODF as custom properties
   - Import/export compatibility considerations
   - Preserve effects during format conversion

BENEFITS:
- Professional image appearance without external editors
- Time savings with one-click presets
- Consistency across documents
- Non-destructive editing
- Enhanced visual communication

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Graphics processing capabilities
- Extended ODF schema for effects
- Preview rendering system
- GPU shader programs
- Image processing algorithms

EXISTING FOUNDATION:
- Basic image properties (brightness, contrast, transparency)
- DrawingLayer infrastructure
- OpenGL/Skia rendering backends
- Style management system
