LaTeX Syntax for Formulas Feature for LibreOffice

OVERVIEW:
This feature would allow users to input mathematical formulas using LaTeX syntax as an alternative to the current Math formula editor syntax. LaTeX is the de facto standard for mathematical typesetting in academia and would make LibreOffice more accessible to researchers, students, and technical writers.

KEY COMPONENTS:

1. LaTeX Input Methods:
   - Direct LaTeX input in Math formula editor
   - Inline LaTeX in Writer documents (e.g., $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$)
   - Display LaTeX blocks (e.g., $$\int_0^1 x^2 dx$$)
   - Import/paste LaTeX code
   - Auto-detection of LaTeX vs. traditional syntax

2. Core LaTeX Support:
   a) Basic Math:
      - Superscripts/subscripts: x^2, a_n
      - Fractions: \frac{a}{b}
      - Roots: \sqrt{x}, \sqrt[n]{x}
      - Greek letters: \alpha, \beta, \gamma
   
   b) Advanced Constructs:
      - Matrices: \begin{matrix}...\end{matrix}
      - Integrals: \int, \oint, \iint
      - Summations: \sum_{i=1}^{n}
      - Limits: \lim_{x \to \infty}
      - Derivatives: \frac{d}{dx}, \partial
   
   c) Environments:
      - align, equation, array
      - cases for piecewise functions
      - Custom spacing commands

3. Implementation Architecture:
   - LaTeX parser/tokenizer
   - Conversion to LibreOffice Math internal format
   - Bidirectional conversion (LaTeX â†” Math syntax)
   - Error handling and syntax validation
   - Preview rendering

4. Technical Implementation:
   a) Parser Design:
      - Lexical analysis for LaTeX tokens
      - Syntax tree construction
      - Semantic validation
      - Conversion to Math formula nodes
   
   b) Integration Points:
      - Math formula editor enhancement
      - Writer inline formula support
      - Import/export filters
      - Clipboard handling

5. User Experience:
   - Toggle between LaTeX and traditional mode
   - Syntax highlighting for LaTeX input
   - Auto-completion for common commands
   - Live preview as you type
   - Error messages with suggestions
   - Help documentation with examples

6. Compatibility Features:
   - Import LaTeX documents
   - Export formulas as LaTeX
   - Copy as LaTeX option
   - Batch conversion tools
   - Template library

7. Advanced Features:
   - Custom macro support
   - Package emulation (amsmath, etc.)
   - Symbol palette with LaTeX names
   - Quick insert for common formulas
   - Formula history/favorites

8. Educational Tools:
   - LaTeX learning mode
   - Side-by-side syntax comparison
   - Interactive tutorials
   - Common formula templates

BENEFITS:
- Familiar syntax for academic users
- Faster formula input for LaTeX users
- Easy migration from LaTeX documents
- Industry-standard compatibility
- Reduced learning curve for students

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- LaTeX parser implementation
- Math formula tree mapping
- Syntax validation engine
- Preview rendering system
- Comprehensive symbol mapping

EXISTING FOUNDATION:
- LibreOffice Math formula engine
- ODF formula representation
- Import/export filter framework
- Formula rendering system
- Unicode math symbol support

IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES:
1. Core LaTeX syntax parser
2. Basic math constructs
3. Integration with Math editor
4. Inline formula support in Writer
5. Advanced environments and symbols
6. Import/export capabilities
7. User interface enhancements
