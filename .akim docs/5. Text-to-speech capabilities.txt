Text-to-Speech Capabilities Feature for LibreOffice

OVERVIEW:
Text-to-speech (TTS) functionality would enable LibreOffice to read documents aloud using system-provided speech synthesis engines. This feature enhances accessibility for visually impaired users and provides proofreading assistance for all users by allowing them to hear their written content.

KEY COMPONENTS:

1. Core TTS Features:
   - Read entire document
   - Read selection
   - Read from cursor position
   - Read by paragraph/sentence/word
   - Continuous reading with pause/resume
   - Speed control (words per minute)
   - Voice selection (male/female/language)
   - Volume control

2. System Integration:
   a) Windows:
      - SAPI (Speech API) integration
      - Windows Speech Platform
      - Access to installed voices
   
   b) Linux:
      - Speech-dispatcher support
      - eSpeak/eSpeak-NG integration
      - Festival TTS support
      - PulseAudio integration
   
   c) macOS:
      - NSSpeechSynthesizer API
      - AVSpeechSynthesizer (newer API)
      - System voice access

3. Reading Controls:
   - Play/Pause/Stop buttons
   - Skip forward/backward
   - Reading position indicator
   - Synchronized highlighting
   - Reading queue management
   - Bookmarks for resume points

4. Advanced Features:
   a) Content Intelligence:
      - Skip headers/footers option
      - Announce formatting changes
      - Spell out acronyms
      - Number pronunciation rules
      - Punctuation verbosity levels
   
   b) Document Structure:
      - Navigate by headings
      - Table reading modes
      - List announcement
      - Footnote handling
      - Comment reading options

5. User Interface:
   - Dedicated TTS toolbar
   - Keyboard shortcuts
   - Context menu integration
   - Settings dialog
   - Voice preview
   - Reading preferences per document

6. Technical Implementation:
   a) Architecture:
      - Abstract TTS interface
      - Platform-specific implementations
      - Audio output handling
      - Thread management for non-blocking playback
   
   b) Text Processing:
      - Text extraction from document
      - Formatting preservation
      - Language detection
      - Pronunciation corrections
      - SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) support

7. Accessibility Integration:
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - NVDA/JAWS coordination
   - VoiceOver integration (macOS)
   - Orca support (Linux)
   - Avoid conflicts with system TTS

8. Performance Considerations:
   - Chunked text processing
   - Background thread for speech
   - Memory management for long documents
   - CPU usage optimization
   - Audio buffer management

9. Export Options:
   - Save as audio file (WAV/MP3)
   - Create audiobook chapters
   - Batch processing
   - Podcast generation
   - Timing information export

BENEFITS:
- Accessibility for visually impaired users
- Proofreading by listening
- Learning support (dyslexia, etc.)
- Multitasking enablement
- Language learning assistance
- Fatigue reduction for long documents

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Platform TTS API bindings
- Audio subsystem integration
- Text processing pipeline
- UI synchronization system
- Accessibility API compliance

EXISTING FOUNDATION:
- Accessibility framework
- Text extraction capabilities
- Platform abstraction layer
- Audio output in Impress
- Internationalization support

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
1. Create abstract TTS interface
2. Implement Windows SAPI backend
3. Implement Linux speech-dispatcher
4. Implement macOS NSSpeechSynthesizer
5. Build basic UI controls
6. Add synchronization features
7. Enhance with advanced options
8. Integrate with accessibility framework

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:
- Default voice per language
