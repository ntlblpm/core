# Features added to writer so far

1. Timer in the status bar (bottom of the app) next to word count that ticks only when the document's window is focused
    - useful for consultants/lawyers billing time, students checking when to take a break
2. Reading time estimate in the status bar:
    - minutes = word count / 200
3. Productivity menu added to menu bar with a "Focus Mode" toggle that:
    - All UI chrome disappears (toolbars, rulers, scrollbars, status bar)
    - Only the document canvas remains visible
    - The previous UI state is saved
    - Toggling Focus Mode again restores the original UI configuration
4. Heading navigation buttons: next heading and previous heading buttons added to bottom toolbar
    - Should add icons at some point instead of just showing text labels
5. Updated line count statistic to not need a button press and improved copy ("Lines: " -> "Lines of text: ")
